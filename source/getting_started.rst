Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

There is a single click installer that installs MSysGit, kdif3 and Git Extensions. The installer will detect 
if 32bit and/or 64bit versions should be installed.
The installer can be found `here <http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/>`_.

    Git Extensions depends heavily on MSysGit. When MSysGit is not installed install this first. Kdiff3 is 
    optional, but is advised as a merge tool.

    Choose the SSH client to use. PuTTY is the default because it has better windows integration.

Settings
--------

All settings will be verified when Git Extensions is started for the first time. If Git Extensions requires 
any settings to be changed the settings dialog will be shown. All incorrect settings will be marked red. You 
can ask Git Extensions to try to fix the setting for you by clicking on it.
